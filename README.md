Explain the purpose of the analysis:
- Create and evaluate a data model predicting credit worthiness of borrowers from P2P lending services.

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model
- Accuracy Score: 95.2%.  Taking into account sensitivity and specificity, the model was 95.2% accurate.
- Precision Score: 92%.  92% of predicted positives were accurate.
- Recall Score: 95%. The model was 95% accurate measuring true positive values of predictions made.

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning
- I recommend using the model due to the 95% accuracy predicting the initial loan repayment outcome.
